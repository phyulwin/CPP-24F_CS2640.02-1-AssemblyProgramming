# MIPS Assembly Projects

This repository contains a collection of MIPS Assembly Language programs focused on core concepts such as:

- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Array manipulation and memory access
- File handling and I/O operations
- Basic program control and branching

These programs were developed as part of coursework assignments and include both required tasks and bonus exercises. The code demonstrates practical implementations of low-level operations in the MIPS architecture using the SPIM or MARS simulators.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered

- **Arithmetic Operations**  
  Performing basic math and logic in MIPS.

- **Array Manipulation**  
  Traversing, reversing, and modifying arrays using indexed memory access.

- **File Handling**  
  Reading from and writing to files using system calls.

- **Control Flow**  
  Conditional logic, loops, and program structure.

## ðŸ›  Tools

- MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)  
- SPIM Simulator
